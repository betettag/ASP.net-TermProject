Welcome to Internet against humanity
The site is a community game of cards against humanity which is akin to apples to apples. You and others get a hand (5 cards), and a prompt to "answer to". the prompt is sometimes a question but it doesn't have to be. Just select the best fitting or funniest card in order to hopefully beat and the other player. The community will see if you are worthy of being the winner of the weekly tournament.
